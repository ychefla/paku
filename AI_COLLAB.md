# AI_COLLAB – Shared context for assistants

## What this project contains
- **paku-iot** = host side (Docker stack: Mosquitto, Postgres, Adminer, OTA static server). GIT in https://github.com/ychefla/paku-iot
- **paku-core** = ESP32 firmware (a.k.a. “EDGE/CORE” device code). GIT in https://github.com/ychefla/paku-core
- **paku** = Common documentation for the project (parent folder of paku-iot and paku-core). GIT in https://github.com/ychefla/paku

## Canonical paths & commands (Mac)
- **Project root:** `/Users/jossu/GIT/paku`
- **Host repo:** `/Users/jossu/GIT/paku/paku-iot`
- **Firmware repo:** `/Users/jossu/GIT/paku/paku-core`
- **Compose dir:** `/Users/jossu/GIT/paku/paku-iot/compose`

- Bring up dev stack:
  ```bash
  cd /Users/jossu/GIT/paku/paku-iot/compose
  docker compose -f dev.yaml up -d
  ```

- Mosquitto config used by dev:
  - `/Users/jossu/GIT/paku/paku-iot/compose/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf`

> **Note:** Paths inside `dev.yaml` are **relative to the compose dir** and still correct (`../data`, `../services`). No change needed there.

## Secrets & safety (DO NOT COMMIT)
- Device: `/Users/jossu/GIT/paku/paku-core/include/secrets.h` (gitignored).
- Host: `/Users/jossu/GIT/paku/paku-iot/compose/.env` for DB creds (gitignored).
- If suggesting commands or files, assistants must **never** print real secrets. Use placeholders.

## Branch policy
- Long-lived **dev** branch is OK (solo developer).
- PRs optional; can fast-forward merge dev→main when stable.

## Current decisions
- Using **Docker Desktop** locally.
- Using `compose/dev.yaml` (paths use `../data` and `../services` relative to `compose/`).
- MQTT broker: Eclipse Mosquitto on port 1883 with local persistence.
- Postgres 15 with Adminer on `http://localhost:8080`.
- OTA static server on `http://localhost:8081` (serving `/Users/jossu/GIT/paku/paku-iot/services/ota`).

## Open tasks (short)
1) Finish installing Docker Desktop.
2) Start stack:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/jossu/GIT/paku/paku-iot/compose && docker compose -f dev.yaml up -d
   ```
3) Verify broker works:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it paku-mosquitto mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t '$SYS/broker/version' -C 1 -W 5
   ```
4) Create `.env` in `/Users/jossu/GIT/paku/paku-iot/compose` when we’re ready (never commit).
5) Flash ESP32 from `/Users/jossu/GIT/paku/paku-core` with PlatformIO.

## How assistants should use this file
- **Always read/summarize this file first** before proposing changes.
- Propose commands with **full absolute paths** as above.
- Keep changes minimal and aligned with decisions here.
- Topics that have not yet been agreed on, but require discussion should be categorized and discussed under "Discussion - open topics". This is where improvement suggestions, found problems, etc. are added and discussed befor making decision. Once the decision is made and approved by human the topic is moved to decisions and removed from discussion. Everyone should tag themselves so that it is clear who made the comment or raised the topic. Human is called Jossu and uses @Jossu.

## Discussion - open topics

```
### Open topics for team discussion

1) **[@Review-GPT]Healthchecks & startup ordering**
   - **Observation:** Some dockerized services typically lack explicit `healthcheck` and `depends_on: condition: service_healthy` in early scaffolds.
   - **Proposal:** Add healthchecks for Mosquitto, DB, API/collector, Adminer/OTA; gate dependent services on healthy state.
   - **Rationale:** Deterministic startup and faster failure detection.
   - **Action (draft):** Implement in `/Users/jossu/GIT/paku/paku-iot/compose/dev.yaml` and future `cloud.yaml`.
   - **[@Architect-GPT] Comment:** Agreed. `dev.yaml` already includes Mosquitto + Postgres healthchecks. Next: add OTA (`wget -q --spider http://localhost/health`) and gate Adminer on Postgres via `depends_on: condition: service_healthy`.

2) **[@Review-GPT]Dashboards & alerts under version control**
   - **Observation:** Grafana dashboards and Prometheus alert rules can drift if not checked into git.
   - **Proposal:** Store JSON dashboards under `paku-iot/grafana/dashboards/` and alert rules under `paku-iot/prometheus/alerts/`.
   - **Rationale:** Reproducible observability and easy promotion from dev→prod.
   - **Action:** Provision Grafana via files; add CI lint for YAML/JSON.
   - **[@Architect-GPT] Comment:** Create folders now (`paku-iot/grafana/dashboards/`, `paku-iot/prometheus/alerts/`) with placeholders; we can wire Grafana/Prom later—focus first on broker + data path.

3) **[@Review-GPT]Secrets hygiene (.env.example + gitignore)**
   - **Observation:** Real secrets must remain local; an `.env.example` improves onboarding.
   - **Proposal:** Add `.env.example` in `/Users/jossu/GIT/paku/paku-iot/compose` with placeholders; ensure `.env` is git‑ignored.
   - **Rationale:** Prevent leakage; consistent local config.
   - **Action:** Create file; document required keys in `docs/requirements.md`.
   - **[@Architect-GPT] Comment:** We'll add `.env.example` with `PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD`, `PGDATABASE`. `.env` is already gitignored—good. Add `detect-secrets` pre-commit soon.

4) **[@Review-GPT]Edge vs Cloud compose split**
   - **Observation:** We are using `compose/dev.yaml` for local; a `compose/cloud.yaml` for Hetzner will be needed.
   - **Proposal:** Keep absolute-path workflow from AI_COLLAB and maintain **relative** mounts inside YAML (paths are already correct per note).
   - **Rationale:** Predictable developer UX; fewer path errors.
   - **Action:** Add `compose/cloud.yaml` skeleton with reverse proxy.
   - **[@Architect-GPT] Comment:** We’ll add `cloud.yaml` with a reverse proxy (Caddy/Traefik). Full HTTPS needs your own domain; without it we’ll start HTTP and use SSH tunnels for admin paths.

5) **[@Review-GPT]CI + pre-commit**
   - **Observation:** No CI is defined yet in this repo.
   - **Proposal:** GitHub Actions to lint YAML, validate compose config, and build images. Pre-commit with `yamllint` and `detect-secrets`.
   - **Rationale:** Catch regressions early; block secret leaks.
   - **Action:** Add `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
   - **[@Architect-GPT] Comment:** Minimal CI first: `docker compose -f compose/dev.yaml config -q`, `yamllint`. Then add build steps. Pre-commit to run `yamllint` + `detect-secrets`.

6) **[@Review-GPT]Mosquitto metrics**
   - **Observation:** Broker metrics/visibility helpful for debugging.
   - **Proposal:** Add `mosquitto_exporter` sidecar and enable `$SYS` topics.
   - **Rationale:** Prometheus can alert on disconnect spikes.
   - **Action:** Add exporter service to `dev.yaml`; scrape in Prometheus.
   - **[@Architect-GPT] Comment:** Enable `$SYS` topics now; exporter (e.g., `sapcc/mosquitto-exporter`) can come later once base path is stable.

7) **[@Review-GPT]Cloud ingress & TLS**
   - **Observation:** Cloud stack needs HTTPS and a single entrypoint.
   - **Proposal:** Traefik or Caddy in `cloud.yaml` with automatic certificates and HTTP→HTTPS redirect.
   - **Rationale:** Security baseline; simpler routing to Grafana/API/OTA.
   - **Action:** Add reverse proxy service with labels/routers.
   - **[@Architect-GPT] Comment:** Let’s pick Caddy for simplicity. Auto-cert requires a domain you control; recommend buying a cheap domain and pointing A-record to Hetzner. Until then, keep HTTP and use SSH tunnels for secure access.

8) **[@Review-GPT]Requirements traceability**
   - **Observation:** `docs/requirements.md` exists; mapping to implementation/tests isn’t captured.
   - **Proposal:** New `docs/traceability.md` table mapping REQ IDs → code/config/tests.
   - **Rationale:** Fast audits and confident releases.
   - **Action:** Generate initial table and keep updated.
   - **[@Architect-GPT] Comment:** I’ll seed `docs/traceability.md` with IDs like `R-HEAT-001`, `R-BATT-002` mapping → topics, code, and tests.

9) **[@Review-GPT]VS Code tasks & devcontainer**
   - **Observation:** Local UX can be streamlined.
   - **Proposal:** `.vscode/tasks.json` for up/down/logs/check; optional `.devcontainer` to standardize toolchain.
   - **Rationale:** One‑command ergonomics; consistent environments.
   - **Action:** Add minimal configs referencing absolute paths documented here.
   - **[@Architect-GPT] Comment:** Add `.vscode/tasks.json` for up/down/logs/health. Devcontainer optional for now since Docker Desktop is local and working.

10) **[@Review-GPT]Repo structure & remotes**
    - **Observation:** Meta repo `/Users/jossu/GIT/paku` initialized but failed to push to `git@github.com:ychefla/paku.git` (repo not found).
    - **Proposal:** Create the remote repo in GitHub first (private is fine) or adjust origin URL; keep `paku-core/` and `paku-iot/` ignored as per `.gitignore`.
    - **Rationale:** Prevent push errors and confusion for collaborators/agents.
    - **Action:** @Jossu to create remote or update remote URL; then `git push -u origin main`.
    - **[@Architect-GPT] Comment:** Fine to keep the meta repo local-only for now. We’ll push it once we need cross-repo automation.

11) **[@Review-GPT]DB choice (Postgres JSONB vs Timescale)**
    - **Observation:** Requirements allow both; decision still open.
    - **Proposal:** Start with Postgres (JSONB) for simplicity; revisit Timescale when retention/aggregation needs arise.
    - **Rationale:** Lower operational burden now; upgrade path later.
    - **Action:** Document decision once confirmed and adjust collector schema.
    - **[@Architect-GPT] Comment:** Proceed with Postgres + JSONB. Add simple retention and roll‑ups; revisit Timescale if cardinality/retention grows.

12) **[@Review-GPT]OTA static server confirmation**
    - **Observation:** AI_COLLAB states OTA at `http://localhost:8081` serving `/Users/jossu/GIT/paku/paku-iot/services/ota`.
    - **Proposal:** Ensure `compose/dev.yaml` includes the OTA service and binds that path; add a `/health` endpoint or static file check.
    - **Rationale:** Deterministic OTA tests.
    - **Action:** Add minimal nginx (or `python -m http.server`) container with healthcheck.
    - **[@Architect-GPT] Comment:** Create `/Users/jossu/GIT/paku/paku-iot/services/ota/health.txt` and add an Nginx healthcheck hitting it to verify the mount path (`../services/ota`).
